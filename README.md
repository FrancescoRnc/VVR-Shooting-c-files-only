# VVR Shooting! c++ files Repo

I'm making a VR Game using Unreal Engine v4.25 mixing Blueprint and C++ programming.  
My goal is to develop this game for Oculus Quest and PC VR.

## Description

I'm still thinking about various kinds of mechanics and assets, but generally:  
In this game you need to shoot to some enemies in order to get the best score as possible.  
You don't need to move around the place, but it's important to have 360° vision because,  
sometimes, you'll be surrounded by ugly foes! 
You can see a demo preview [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os6DOAQWLZk)

## How this Repo works

I use this Repo just to show off the code i've written for this project,  
so I'll publish ONLY .h and .cpp files i've created for the project.  
I'll do an appropriate Repo for the game in future.
